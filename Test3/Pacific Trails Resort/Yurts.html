Yurts at Pacific Trails
</h2>

<dt><strong>What is a yurt?
</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
    Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

    How are the yurts furnished?
</strong>
</dt>
    <dd>
        Each yurt is furnished with a queen size bed with down quit and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

        What should I bring?
        </strong>
    </dt>
        <dd>
            Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It is also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
